In such cases, non-linear regression models or other machine learning techniques that can handle non-linear relationships might be more appropriate.\n",

However, if the dataset is not prone to overfitting or if the number of predictors is relatively small compared to the number of observations, the regularization effect may be minimal. In such scenarios, using regularized linear models may not provide significant benefits over standard linear regression models.\n",

It is crucial to assess the validity of these assumptions and consider alternative regression approaches, such as generalized linear models, if necessary.\n",
